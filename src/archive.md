# nes.science Archive

There's a lot of good information about how to program the NES out there... and a lot of it is on sites that could one day 
disappear. I'm trying to archive some of the good stuff, so it's easy to access if anything bad ever happens.

Got something you think belongs here? Get in contact and maybe we can sort out mirroring it here.

## Tutorials

### [Nerdy Nights Mirror](https://nerdy-nights.nes.science)

This is a fully-featured backup of the nerdy nights tutorials to get started with NES development. 

I rehosted this off the nintendoage forums, in case anything bad ever happens to it. There is also a downloadable version, as well as a PDF created by 
[Fuzzy](https://fuzzytek.ml/).

## General Development Utilities

### [NESDev Wiki Mirror](http://nesdev-wiki.nes.science/)

This is a dump of [the nesdev wiki](https://www.nesdev.org/) I update from time to time. 
If the main nesdev wiki is ever down, you can go here to find any page. Just replace wiki.nesdev.org with nesdev-wiki.nes.science!

Note that if the wiki is NOT down, I highly recommend going to the original wiki instead! This is likely a bit behind, and you can't edit it if you find issues.

This is entirely based on the work of Tepples on [his wiki backup](https://pineight.com/nesdev-temp/wikipages/)

## Discussion Forums

### [NESDev Forums](https://nesdev.nes.science/)

This is a read-only dump of [The NESDev forums](https://forums.nesdev.org/) I update from time to time. 
If the main NESDev forums ever go down, this should be around to find old posts. 
You won't be able to post or anything else, but it's there for information.

Note that if the forum is NOT down, I highly recommend going to the original forum instead! 
This is likely a bit behind, and you can't post or reply.

### [NintendoAge Forums](https://archive.nes.science/nintendoage-forums/)

This is a read-only dump of The NintendoAge forums from before they were taken down. 
You won't be able to post, but the information is all here. Or at least, as much as could be found.
