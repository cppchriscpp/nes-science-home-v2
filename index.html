<p>This domain is a home to a bunch of random NES stuff I've done over time. My main website is <a href="https://cpprograms.net">cpprograms.net</a>, but this tries to
isolate all of the retro gaming stuff into one spot.</p>
<h2>Games, Projects and More</h2>
<h3><a href="https://puzzle.nes.science">Puzzle Game Maker</a></h3>
<p>This is a puzzle game maker I wrote, which will let you make your own game with up to 64 levels, playable on
a real nes! (Or an emulator).</p>
<p>It aims to be simple enough for anyone to figure out! It includes default art and music, with the option
to substitute your own.</p>
<h3><a href="https://cppchriscpp.github.io/nes-starter-kit">NES Starter Kit</a></h3>
<p>NES Starter Kit is s a fully-fledged starter kit for NES games. It is the source to a top-down adventure game, alongside all of the tools needed to change it.
It also comes with a guide to changing everything about it, which could also be titled &quot;The dummy's guide to creating an NES game&quot;.</p>
<p>The idea is, download this (either via git or a zip file), set up the tools, run the game, then tweak it and make your own! With the right hardware, you can even play your game on your own NES.</p>
<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<h3><a href="https://nerdy-nights.nes.science">Nerdy Nights Mirror</a></h3>
<p>This is a fully-featured backup of the nerdy nights tutorials to get started with NES development.</p>
<p>I rehosted this off the nintendoage forums, in case anything bad ever happens to it. There is also a downloadable version, as well as a PDF created by
<a href="https://fuzzytek.ml/">Fuzzy</a>.</p>

<h2>Retro Dev Tools</h2>
<h3><a href="https://cppchriscpp.github.io/create-nes-game">create-nes-game</a></h3>
<p>create-nes-game is a command line tool that creates a simple hello world game for the NES, alongside all build tools you need, and a ready-to-go emulator.</p>
<p>All you have to do is answer a series of multiple-choice questions about what language you want, a mapper, and optional features like libraries.</p>
<p>The tool will give you a git-ready folder full of code, which it can be used to compile and run. (and even unit test, if you want!)</p>
<h3><a href="https://cppchriscpp.github.io/nes-test">nes-test</a></h3>
<p>A simple jasmine + mesen-based test runner for the NES. Validate that your generated roms have the proper size/signature, and do the right things when you run them.</p>
<p>Has integration with cc65 output and create-nes-game, so you can inspect C/asm variables, as well as compare screenshots.</p>
<h3><a href="https://cppchriscpp.github.io/2bit-tile-generator">2Bit Tile Generator</a></h3>
<p>This is a quick-and-dirty react app put together to generate some simple tiles for retro-styled games.</p>
<p>It directly targets the Nintendo gameboy and NES, but may be able to be used with other consoles as well.</p>
<p>It outputs png files, as well as NES-compatible chr and pal files.</p>
<h3><a href="https://mapper.nes.science">NES Mapper Picker</a></h3>
<p>This is a pretty simple vue app meant to allow you to pick what mapper best works for you based on a varied set of parameters.</p>
<p>There are a few tools out there that already do this, but I've found that they generally have one of two pitalls - either they do not let you change
your mind without going through the whole selection process again, or they just don't consider the features I want.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/cppchriscpp/nez">NEZ Fork</a></h3>
<p>This is a fork of the web-based Nez emulator to make it more friendly to embedding games.
I use this on my own website to show off the various games and demos I've made.</p>
